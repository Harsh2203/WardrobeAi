üìù Wardrobe App Progress Tracker (Prefilled + Learning Notes)

1. General Info

Project Name: Wardrobe AI App

Start Date: [Add your start date]

Current Phase: Phase 1 (Foundations)

Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, React Native, Firebase/AWS S3

Learning Phase: Yes ‚Äî every step will include explanations of why/how tools, libraries, and methods are used.

2. Daily / Weekly Log Table

Day / Week	Date	Learned Concepts	Implemented Features	Issues / Errors	Next Tasks	Learning Notes
1		Spring Boot basics, REST API, CRUD, Postgres setup	User signup API, DB connection	None	Test user CRUD	Learned why Spring Boot is used (rapid REST API setup), why Postgres is chosen (reliable, relational DB)
2		Controller, Service, Repository layers	Update user API	Null pointer in update	Add delete user API	Learned separation of concerns: Controller handles HTTP, Service handles business logic, Repository talks to DB
3		Delete API, Postman testing	Delete user API	None	Add validations for user fields	Learned why testing with Postman helps verify APIs before frontend integration
4		Spring Boot layers review, business logic separation	User CRUD complete (create, read, update, delete)	None	Move to Item CRUD (upload clothes)	Reinforced layer responsibilities; ready to extend for Items table
5		Bean validations (@Valid, @NotBlank, @Email, @Size)	Start adding validation in user API	Test with Postman	Complete validations and test all CRUD	Learned why validations are needed (data integrity, user feedback, avoiding bad DB entries)
6		‚Äî	‚Äî	‚Äî	Start implementing Item (Clothes) CRUD and image upload	Will explain why we use MultipartFile for image uploads, why cloud storage like Firebase/S3 is recommended

3. Phase Overview

Phase	Duration	Goal	Status	Notes
Phase 1	Week 1‚Äì2	Basic CRUD + login + wardrobe grid	In Progress	Completed user CRUD, testing with Postman; learning phase with explanations
Phase 2	Week 3‚Äì5	Auto-tag clothes, filters	Pending	Will explain Vision API, color/type extraction, rule engine
Phase 3	Week 6‚Äì8	Outfit suggestions	Pending	Will explain embeddings, recommendation scoring, color harmony
Phase 4	Week 9‚Äì10	Smart imports, OCR	Pending	Will explain Tesseract / Google Vision OCR and parsing logic
Phase 5	Week 11‚Äì12	Polish & deployment	Pending	Will explain deployment steps (Heroku/AWS) and frontend integration

5. Notes / References

Postman test endpoints: /users CRUD

Validations to add: @NotBlank, @Email, @Size, optional unique email constraint

Spring Boot layers: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí DB

Learning Phase Notes:

Every step includes why we use each tool or annotation.

Example: @RestController = handles HTTP responses in JSON.

Example: Postgres = stores relational data, supports indexing, queries, and can scale.

Example: @Valid = ensures only correct data is saved; prevents backend errors.
