2. Daily / Weekly Log Table

Day / Week	Date	Learned Concepts	Implemented Features	Issues / Errors	Next Tasks	Learning Notes
1		Spring Boot basics, REST API, CRUD, Postgres setup	User signup API, DB connection	None	Test user CRUD	Learned why Spring Boot is used (rapid REST API setup), why Postgres is chosen (reliable, relational DB)
2		Controller, Service, Repository layers	Update user API	Null pointer in update	Add delete user API	Learned separation of concerns: Controller handles HTTP, Service handles business logic, Repository talks to DB
3		Delete API, Postman testing	Delete user API	None	Add validations for user fields	Learned why testing with Postman helps verify APIs before frontend integration
4		Spring Boot layers review, business logic separation	User CRUD complete (create, read, update, delete)	None	Move to Item CRUD (upload clothes)	Reinforced layer responsibilities; ready to extend for Items table
5		Bean validations (@Valid, @NotBlank, @Email, @Size)	Start adding validation in user API	Test with Postman	Complete validations and test all CRUD	Learned why validations are needed (data integrity, user feedback, avoiding bad DB entries)
6		—	—	—	Start implementing Item (Clothes) CRUD and image upload	Will explain why we use MultipartFile for image uploads, why cloud storage like Firebase/S3 is recommended

3. Phase Overview

Phase	Duration	Goal	Status	Notes
Phase 1	Week 1–2	Basic CRUD + login + wardrobe grid	In Progress	Completed user CRUD, testing with Postman; learning phase with explanations
Phase 2	Week 3–5	Auto-tag clothes, filters	Pending	Will explain Vision API, color/type extraction, rule engine
Phase 3	Week 6–8	Outfit suggestions	Pending	Will explain embeddings, recommendation scoring, color harmony
Phase 4	Week 9–10	Smart imports, OCR	Pending	Will explain Tesseract / Google Vision OCR and parsing logic

5. Notes / References

Postman test endpoints: /users CRUD

Validations to add: @NotBlank, @Email, @Size, optional unique email constraint

Spring Boot layers: Controller → Service → Repository → DB

Learning Phase Notes:

Every step includes why we use each tool or annotation.

Example: @RestController = handles HTTP responses in JSON.

Example: Postgres = stores relational data, supports indexing, queries, and can scale.

Example: @Valid = ensures only correct data is saved; prevents backend errors.

Day 5 — Update API with Validations

Date: (add today’s date)

Goal:

Implement updateUser API with proper input validation.

Understand Controller → Service → Repository flow.

What We Are Using:

Spring Boot (@RestController, @Autowired)

Spring Data JPA (UserRepository)

Bean Validation (@NotBlank, @Email, @Size)

@Valid in Controller

@PathVariable to get id from URL

Logic / Flow:

Controller receives PUT request /user/update/{id}

Input fields validated automatically via @Valid and annotations

Service layer checks if user exists in DB:

If not → return "User not found"

If exists:

Update email and password

Optional: check for duplicate email

Save updated user in DB

Return success message → "User updated successfully"

Extra Challenge:

Prevent duplicate email updates by checking DB

Understand why we use @PathVariable

Next Steps:

Implement the validations in User.java

Test API using Postman with valid and invalid inputs

Observe automatic error messages for invalid inputs
